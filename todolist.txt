bali amo ini:  5. Start Documenting Breakdowns
In your Codex, keep a log:

ðŸ”§ "Form didnâ€™t submit â€” 2025-06-25"

Issue: I forgot form = useForm()

Fix: Added useForm and declared fields

What I learned: Donâ€™t forget forceFormData if using files

This will reduce repeat frustration and builds a library of your own solutions.




LAST: do a automatic backup, what i mean by this is use a automation uploading of csv into google drive every 30days
 so that the data in your db won't be erased incase something happened. also try if you can upload the db itself.
